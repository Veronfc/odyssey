**Odyssey** is a real-time multiplayer card game. Built with a modern monorepo architecture, it emphasizes responsive gameplay, type-safe communication, and scalable game logic.

## üéØ Description

Odyssey is a turn-based card game where multiple players can compete in real time. It features a matchmaking queue, WebSocket-based interaction, persistent player progress, and leaderboard tracking. The game runs on a lightweight Bun + Elysia backend with Vue 3 handling the client interface.

## üöÄ Planned Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay (WebSockets)
- Matchmaking system using Redis queues
- Game rooms with in-memory state using Redis
- End-to-end type safety via Eden Treaty
- Leaderboards and match history via PostgreSQL
- Authentication & persistent user data
- Visual game board with dynamic card rendering
- Scalable deployment (Bun backend, Vite frontend)
