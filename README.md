**Odyssey** is a real-time multiplayer card game. Built with a modern monorepo architecture, it emphasizes responsive gameplay, type-safe communication, and scalable game logic.

## üéØ Description

Odyssey is a turn-based card game where multiple players can compete in real time. It features a matchmaking queue, WebSocket-based interaction, persistent player progress, and leaderboard tracking. The game runs on a lightweight Bun + Elysia backend with Vue 3 handling the client interface.

## üöÄ Planned Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay (WebSockets)
- Matchmaking system using Redis queues
- Game rooms with in-memory state using Redis
- End-to-end type safety via Eden Treaty
- Leaderboards and match history via PostgreSQL
- Authentication & persistent user data
- Visual game board with dynamic card rendering
- Scalable deployment (Bun backend, Vite frontend)

## ‚úÖ Project Workflow

- [ ] **Milestone 1: Project Setup**
  - [ ] Initialize Bun project and install dependencies
  - [ ] Set up Elysia routes and folder structure
  - [ ] Set up Vue project with Tailwind and Pinia
  - [ ] Create base folder structure

- [ ] **Milestone 2: Core API & Type Safety**

  - [ ] Sync via WebSocket updates

- [ ] **Milestone 4: Real-Time Communication**
  - [ ] Events: `playerJoin`, `move`, `gameOver`
  - [ ] Redis Pub/Sub for room-wide broadcast
  - [ ] Composable for managing socket events
  - [ ] Push events to Pinia

- [ ] **Milestone 5: Game Logic**
  - [ ] Implement draw, turn-switch, win/lose logic
  - [ ] Validate and sync moves
  - [ ] Animate card draws, turns, player actions

- [ ] **Milestone 6: Persistence Layer**
  - [ ] Tables for users, games, leaderboards
  - [ ] Save match history post-game

- [ ] **Milestone 7: Matchmaking**
  - [ ] Use LPUSH/RPOP to match players
  - [ ] Auto-assign rooms
  - [ ] Show lobby and queue indicators

- [ ] **Milestone 8: Deployment**
  - [ ] Deploy Bun app (e.g., Fly.io, Railway)
  - [ ] Connect Redis and PG providers
  - [ ] Deploy via Vercel/Netlify
  - [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
