# 🃏 Odyssey

**Odyssey** is a real-time multiplayer card game built with a modern monorepo architecture. It emphasizes responsive gameplay, type-safe communication, and cleanly separated concerns between server and client.

## 🎯 Description

Odyssey is a turn-based card game where 2–4 players compete in real-time. It features a guest-first authentication flow, in-memory matchmaking and game state, and WebSocket-based communication for fast, responsive gameplay.

## 🚀 Planned Features

- Real-time multiplayer gameplay (WebSockets over Hono)
- Matchmaking with in-memory queues and lobby limits
- Game sessions with composable-style server-side state
- Guest-first JWT-based authentication
- End-to-end type safety via shared types
- Optional future: persistent user accounts, match history, and leaderboards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) — JavaScript runtime
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) — Lightweight web framework
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) — Schema validation for endpoints and server logic
- Composable-style server state managers (`usePlayers`, `useLobbies`, `useMatches`)
- JWT authentication
- WebSocket server with custom event system

### Frontend (Later Phase)
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) — Client-side state synced with server
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) — Shared validation schemas
- [vee-validate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/) — Form validation for Vue

### Post-MVP / Experimental
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) — Account persistence, match history
- Account migration (guest → user)
- Spectator mode & replays
- In-game chat / reactions
